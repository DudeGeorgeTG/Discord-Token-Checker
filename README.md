## Features

- 🚀 **Asynchronous** - Checks multiple tokens simultaneously for maximum speed
- ✅ **Validation** - Verifies tokens against Discord's API (canary endpoint)
- 📊 **User Info** - Displays user ID and username for valid tokens
- 📁 **File I/O** - Reads from `tokens.txt` and saves to `valid.txt`
- 🛡️ **Rate Limit Aware** - Limits concurrent connections to avoid bans

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-token-checker.git
   cd discord-token-checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp
   ```

## Usage

1. Add your tokens to `tokens.txt` (one token per line)
2. Run the checker:
   ```bash
   python checker.py
   ```
3. Valid tokens will be saved in `valid.txt`

## Example Output

```
Valid Token: 123456789012345678 | DiscordUser#1234
Valid Token: 987654321098765432 | AnotherUser#5678

Saved 2 valid tokens to valid.txt
```

### Additional Tips:
1. For better GitHub visibility, add relevant tags like `discord`, `token-checker`, `python`, etc.
2. Consider adding a `.gitignore` file to exclude `tokens.txt` and `valid.txt` from version control
3. You might want to add a requirements.txt file with `aiohttp` listed
